# Sam-Hekman-CS7276-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 using the MNIST dataset

Includes Parts 1-4

Part 1: Plot precision, recall, and decision function threshhold. In this case at 90%.

Part 2: Train SGD model for multiclassification and find/plot confusion matrix and error analysis.

Part 3: Increase multiclass accuracy to at least 97% and display precision, recall, F1 score metrics. 
        Was done using a KNN model.

Part 4: Using data augmentation, increase multiclass accuracy to at least 98%.
        By shifting image pixels up, down, left, and right, increased training data to 300,000 from 60,000
        This was done using a KNN model.
